  Google Trends. Trends (number of hits) over the time as well as geographic representation of the results can 
  be displayed. This version has been improved by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.  Dirk Eddelbuettel changed the result
  parsing, added \code{\link[xts]{xts}} support to trends as a time series, and added some S3 methods and generics.
